                <p>
                    A fuel cell electric vehicle contains a tungsten oxide-coated membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The dark ground underneath represents an MEA, 
                    and the water indicates proton-intercalcated tungsten oxide. You et al. 
                    developed a tungsten oxide coating that can be applied during fabrication to prevent catalyst corrosion and durability loss. 
                    This coating holds promise in development of hydrogen-based industries and may lead to more eco-friendly cities.
