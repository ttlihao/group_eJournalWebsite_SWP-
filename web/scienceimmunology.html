                    An Innate GPS. Dendritic cells (DCs) migrate over large distances to transport antigen to lymph nodes, but precisely how DCs navigate the way to their destination is unclear. 
                    Alanko et al. identified that the chemokine receptor CCR7 serves as both a sensor and a sink for the chemokine CCL19, a dual function which facilitates accurate DC migration. 
                    This month?s cover shows a maximum projection image of tracks from a live imaging experiment in which DCs migrate out of a cell reservoir under agarose in response to CCL19.
