                <p> 
                    Autonomous Drone Racing. A neural network policy using reinforcement learning enables autonomous agile drone racing at high speed. 
                    Song et al. report on how reinforcement learning outperforms methods using optimal control by permitting the discovery of more robust control responses for unmodeled dynamics. 
                    The policy, which requires minimal training, was deployed on autonomous drones and shown to outrace professional human drone pilots by successfully 
                    completing laps around a gated track with shorter times and with higher peak velocity. 
                    This month?s cover image is a time-lapse image of the drone autonomously flying through gates on a racetrack.
